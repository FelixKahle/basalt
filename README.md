# Basalt

A high-performance, general-purpose C++ library for scientific computing, designed as a building block for larger projects.

## Overview

Basalt provides efficient implementations of common data structures, algorithms, and utilities for high-performance scientific computing applications. Rather than reinventing the wheel, Basalt builds upon well-established libraries like Eigen and Abseil to provide a cohesive, modern C++ interface.

## Design Principles

- **Performance First** - Zero-overhead abstractions with compile-time optimizations
- **Type Safety** - Modern C++ with concepts, templates, and strong type checking
- **Standards Compliance** - Built on established libraries (Abseil, GoogleTest)
- **Modularity** - Clean separation of concerns with minimal dependencies
